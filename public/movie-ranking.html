<h2>My Best Movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Dunkirk</h3>
<p>I don't usually like war movies, but this one was one of my best ever movies. The storytelling as well as the cinematography is absolutely the best.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>A superhero movie where you do not see the protagonist glorified. Full of action scenes and love the chaotic ending where batty does not harm the joker, staying true to his values till the last.</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>An Amir Khan classic movie. A must watch for all the peeps who have not seen it. The story goes through a life of some Indian undergraduate school students, their struggles and their redemption.</p>
